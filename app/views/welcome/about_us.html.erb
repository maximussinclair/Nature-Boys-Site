    <h3>The Beginning</h3>
    <br>
    <p1>Many, many years ago, in a land far, far away‚Ä¶ Max started growth hacking!
      <br>
      <br>The Nature Boys story starts with Max its founder starting another company
      called Eco Companion. This startup, like any other small business needed attention and growth to get going.
      <br>
      <br>So Max discovered a little thing called growth hacking and took to it fast - learning
      the ways of the growth hacker on Twitter, quickly reaching mastery, delivering over 10,000
      users to the site each month. With this, building strong, consistent revenue growth and ultimately investment!
      <br>
      <br>As Instagram then became the dominant force the same lessons were transferred over.
      Then as others started asking for help with their own social following, this quickly
      progressed from helping a couple of friends out, all the way up to an entirely new and
      impactful organisation of its own that we have today!
      <br>
      <br>The particular focus on quality and conversion above all else to really deliver on
      company goals is born from learning these techniques through implementing on an existing business
      that continues to flourish to this day!

    <h3>Today</h3>
    <br>
    <p1>We‚Äôve gone from a man to a team! (see below)
      <br>
      <br>We‚Äôve continued to develop more and more effective systems around our own automation software
      and the support we offer alongside this to ultimately deliver a more effective and complete package for each client.
      <br>
      <br>We continue to learn at a faster and faster rate. This is thanks to our
      vantage point looking after over 200 client‚Äôs Instagram accounts and 150 our own
      personal network of accounts!
      <br>
      <br>Thanks to this constant progression our network has grown to over 2m to date and
      now grows at a rate of over 100k p/m!
      <br>
      <br>We strive to be the most complete and affordable service for amplifying your growth!
